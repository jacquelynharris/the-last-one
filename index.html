                    <p class="copy">In a city known to be to be as lonely as it is unaffordable, 40% of seniors in Manhattan live alone. As the baby boomer generation ages into retirement, the senior population in New York City needs more affordable housing and support. One program is proposing a solution by matchmaking senior roommates.

                    <p class="copy">The New York Foundation for Senior Citizens provides a home sharing service for seniors that connects strangers to be viable roommates. A “host,” someone with an extra room in their home, is matched by the Foundation with a “guest” to live with them. Only one of the participants has to be over 60 years old. Some roommate matches can last up to 20 years, and since 1981 there have been 2,500 matches. </p>
                    <p class="copy">“Originally when we started we thought about how seniors feel isolated, lonely,” says Linda Hoffman, President of the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens.”And as time went on we found more and more that it's been financial.” </p>

                    <p class="copy"> However, while plenty of guests are applying and looking for housing, there are far fewer hosts willing to open their homes up to strangers. Currently, there are 117 active guest applicants while there are only 35 active host applicants. The impact is a drop in the bucket for seniors struggling to hold onto their housing.</p>
                    <p class="copy">Emma Snowden, 70, says that while she understands why some people would participate in the home share program, she would never apply. She’s rented out a room in her West Harlem affordable housing unit before, but only to people she already knew.</p>
                    <p class="copy">“I’m not generally that trusting. I even have a problem with Airbnb,” Snowden says. She says other seniors may have trust issues with tenants in their home, especially in New York.</p>
                    <p class="copy">“New York is a difficult city to undo stuff in. If you have people live in your home, it’s hard to get them out.” Even if the roommate was a good fit, Snowden says she still doesn’t like the idea of someone else in her home. “At a certain age in our (seniors’) lives we get set in our ways.”</p>
                    <p class="copy"> Paul Covington, 81, thought of renting his Harlem unit out on Airbnb to cover the costs of the apartment he bought in 1998 when he heard about the home share program from his son. He was successfully matched with a roommate over the summer after an extensive application process. Covington says it takes a certain kind of person to participate in the home share program: “People who have faith in people and believe that we have more goodness than bad.”
